    - ###### UpperCaseSelectedText when true upper cases selectedText before replacing %ST% with it.
    - ###### LinkifyFixedText when true replaces spaces and tabs by dashes and removes all disallowed characters from fixedText before replacing %FT% with it.
    - ###### newTextList:
      0. "\[%ST%\]\(\#%FT%\)"
        - Wrap a link in the current file.
      1. "\[%ST%\]\(./fileOne.md\#%FT%\)",

          - Select text to wrap in a link in an editor buffer.
            - Select "Hello there!" alt-ctrl-w, 0 will replace "Hello there!" with "\\[Hello there!\\]\\(#hello-there\\)"
            - Select "Hello there!" alt-ctrl-w, 1 will replace "Hello there!" with "\\[Hello there!\\]\\(./fileOne.md#hello-there\\)"
